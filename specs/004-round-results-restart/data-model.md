### GuessEntry (unchanged)

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `participantId` | `string` | must match a participant `id` | Who submitted the guess |
| `guess` | `string` | non-empty after trim, max 100 chars | The trimmed guess text |

### RoomSnapshot (updated)

Public view of a room returned to clients.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `code` | `string` | Room code |
| `status` | `RoomStatus` | Current status (now includes `"results"`) |
| `participants` | `Participant[]` | Visible player list (includes `score`) |
| `hostId` | `string` | ID of the current host |
| `drawerId` | `string \| null` | ID of the current drawer (null in lobby) |
| `currentWord` | `string \| null` | Secret word if viewer is drawer **OR** if `status === "results"`; otherwise `null` |
| `availableWords` | `string[]` | Fixed word list for the game |
| `scores` | `Record<string, number>` | Map of participant ID to current score |
| `guessHistory` | `GuessEntry[]` | All guesses submitted in this round |
| `canvasStrokes` | `Stroke[]` | Current canvas drawing state |

## Relationships

- One **Room** contains many **Participant** (1:N).
- A **Room** maintains one ordered list of **GuessEntry** (1:N).
- A **Room** maintains one ordered list of **Stroke** (1:N).
- A **GuessEntry** belongs to exactly one **Participant**.

## Validation Rules

1. `currentWord` is visible to all viewers when `room.status === "results"`; otherwise only the drawer sees it.
2. New player joins are rejected when `room.status === "results"` (same restriction as `"playing"`).
3. Guess submissions are rejected when `room.status !== "playing"`.
4. Only the host may trigger `endRound` or `restartGame`; otherwise rejected with `403`.
5. `endRound` is accepted from any `status`, but primary use is `"playing" -> "results"`.
6. `restartGame` is only accepted when `room.status === "results"`; otherwise rejected with `409`.
7. On restart, `scores`, `guessHistory`, `canvasStrokes`, `drawerId`, and `currentWord` are all cleared; `participants` and `hostParticipantId` are preserved.

## State Transitions

```
lobby ──[host starts, >=2 players]──> playing
playing ──[all non-drawers guessed correctly]──> results
playing ──[host manually ends]──> results
playing ──[drawer leaves]──> lobby
playing ──[host leaves]──> lobby
results ──[host restarts]──> lobby
```

- **lobby**: `scores` empty, `guessHistory` empty, `canvasStrokes` empty, `drawerId` null, `currentWord` null.
- **playing**: `scores` initialized to 0, `guessHistory` and `canvasStrokes` accumulate.
- **results**: Round state is preserved (`scores`, `guessHistory`, `canvasStrokes`, `currentWord`, `drawerId`) so it can be displayed. No new guesses accepted.
- **lobby (after restart)**: All round state cleared; players and host preserved.

## Lifecycle

- **Creation**: `POST /rooms` → room created with empty round state.
- **Join**: `POST /rooms/:code/join` → rejected if `status !== "lobby"`.
- **Start**: `POST /rooms/:code/start` → `status = "playing"`.
- **End Round**: `POST /rooms/:code/end` → `status = "results"`.
- **Restart**: `POST /rooms/:code/restart` → `status = "lobby"`; round state cleared.
- **Cleanup**: Room deleted when `participants.length === 0`. Idle `lobby` rooms cleaned up after 10 minutes. `results` rooms also eligible for 10-minute idle cleanup.
