# Quickstart: Round Results and Game Restart

## Prerequisites

- Backend dev server running: `cd backend && npm run dev` (port 3001)
- Frontend dev server running: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (port 5173)
- Two browser tabs (or more) for multiplayer validation

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Host Manually Ends Round

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in Tab A. Create a room as "Alice".
2. Join the same room in Tab B as "Bob".
3. In Tab A (host), click **Start Game**.
4. In Tab A, as the drawer, draw a stroke on the canvas.
5. In Tab B, submit an incorrect guess (e.g., `pizza`).
6. In Tab A, click an **End Round** button (to be added in implementation).

**Expected Outcome**: Both tabs transition to a results view within ~3 seconds. The secret word is visible to both Alice and Bob. Scores and guess history are displayed.

### Scenario 2: Automatic Round End (All Guessers Correct)

1. Complete steps 1–3 from Scenario 1.
2. In Tab B, submit the correct word.
3. If there are additional guesser tabs, have each submit the correct word.

**Expected Outcome**: Once the last non-drawer participant submits a correct guess, all tabs automatically transition to `results` state within ~3 seconds (on next poll). The secret word, scores, and history are visible to all.

### Scenario 4: Non-Host Cannot End or Restart

1. Complete Scenario 1 so the room is in `results` state.
2. In Tab B (non-host), attempt to click **End Round** or **Restart**.

**Expected Outcome**: The action is rejected with a clear error message (e.g., "Only the host can perform this action"). The UI does not transition.

### Scenario 5: Restart Clears Round State

1. Complete Scenario 1 so the room is in `results` state.
2. In Tab A (host), click **Restart Game**.

**Expected Outcome**: Within ~3 seconds, both tabs show the lobby screen with Alice and Bob still present. The secret word, scores, guess history, and canvas are all cleared.

### Scenario 6: Join Rejected in Results State

1. Complete Scenario 1 so the room is in `results` state.
2. Open Tab C and attempt to join the room code.

**Expected Outcome**: The join attempt is rejected with a message that the game is already in progress.
